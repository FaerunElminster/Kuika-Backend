# Kuika Hackathon Sentiment Analysis Backend
This is a backend I coded from Kuika AI Hackathon using FastAPI and Selenium. You need an Open AI key if you have and you are good to go! It is specifically designed for Trendyol to webscrape a products url but if you know how to web scrape it will work for any url. Just be aware of the dates' formats!
